[[logging]]
== Logging

Whilst developing with Elasticsearch .NET client, it can be extremely valuable to see the generated 
requests sent to Elasticsearch, as well as the returned responses.

One way of capturing this information during development is to capture requests and 
responses using Fiddler.

== Debugging
